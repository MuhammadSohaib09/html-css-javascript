HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of web pages using a system of tags or elements that tell the browser how to display text, images, links, and other content. HTML uses various tags like <div>, <h1>, <p>, <a>, and <img> to structure content, and these tags are nested within one another to form the layout of a page.

In addition to providing structure, HTML also works with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. While HTML handles the content and structure, CSS controls the presentation (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing), and JavaScript adds dynamic behavior (e.g., animations, form validations). Together, these three technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—form the backbone of modern web development.

HTML documents are typically saved with the .html or .htm file extension and are rendered by web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The language itself is constantly evolving, with the latest version, HTML5, introducing features like native audio and video support, more semantic elements, and improved accessibility.

Overall, HTML is fundamental for anyone learning web development, as it serves as the foundation for creating and understanding web pages.
